# ServiceX for NtupleMaker

## Overview
[`ServiceX`](https://github.com/ssl-hep/ServiceX), a component of the IRIS-HEP DOMA group's iDDS, is an experiment-agnostic service to enable on-demand data delivery from data lakes in different data formats, including Apache Arrow and ROOT ntuple.

ServiceX reads `ROOT` flat ntuple files to perform a selection then deliver selected branches.
